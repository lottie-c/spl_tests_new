Files with UML (*.ucls) diagrams can be opened in ObjectAid UML Explorer
tool for Eclipse (http://www.objectaid.com/).

If some errors like "Exact search failed for class 'pkg.AClass' in project
'projectName'" occurs, then it is needed to open the file in some text editor
and replace project="projectName" with the actual name of the project.
